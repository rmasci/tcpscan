  check if those ports are open / closed / filtered but without creating a 
  scanning tool that can really look for vulnerabilities. 
  
  Netcat for example was written to exploit vulnerabilitys, nmap is also
  used to learn and exploit vulnerabilities, tcpscan just scans, pings, does
  TLS checking.  It can scan a range of ports, but only 2000 of them at a time. 
  It's not meant to be a discovery tool, but validation tool.
